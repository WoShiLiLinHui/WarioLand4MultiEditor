#   MutiEditor for Wario Land 4 is being made with VB
## PS: patch applications will be made with C++
## 
##     The App will update sometimes. When Updating the release App, i'd like to add a number after filename just for counting the update time. 
##     The Visual MAP editor can run now, you can try this to render one layer,if you want to make sothing change, you can make up your own MOD file according to the JPG files and load one into the App if editing the layer, I am planning to make an engine to manage MOD files initially, not by machine learning or something sophisticated, and perhaps I will need help when start to do it.
##      Without WL4 hacking information, it will be difficult to use it properly when you try to edit enimies and some other small things, I will try to make wizard if some part of hacking is completed.
##      I suppose you to run the App in administrator mode in case it crushes for cannot use ActiveX widgets.
##      If you want to run the App, you also need COMDLG32.OCX (x86) and comctl32.ocx (x86) to run the App properlly.(download them and put it in the path of the exe file, the files are in old version so I suppose you to download them althougth they are contained in any of your Microsoft .NET framework.)
##    I recently change the language from Chinese to English for publishing, all the important parts has been translated but there might be sth not included and some bad expression haven't been fixed. so not all the things are showed in English now.
##      The sprites editor sometimes will not render the sprites properly, you need to use the slider to correct it.
##     If you want to rebuild the level but not for a test (now you can only find suitable Tile text for yourself in the room or other rooms use the same tileset to make suitable change Or try to use the incompleted Visual editor), you need to expand your source gba file, which is available as a patch program here now, rewrite data usually need more room.
##      This is an example:

## for those who want to remake the game
### I just want to remake the game in level in origin ROM, it is just an interest. If you want to ask what it will be like, I will mention another popular game Super Mario Maker as an example. with enougth things you can operate, you are able to remake the game.
### Its just a Wario Land 4 fan's homemake repo for all my project, I won't change the charactor or the game mode. I suppose you to make your own version for your own taste. If you would like to make your own game version by this App and want to improve the present working condition, you can go to CONTRIBUTING.md or help me something in folder what_I_am_doing. This App update and build frequently and you are supposed to download newly build version weekly.
