#   MutiEditor for Wario Land 4 made with VB
##    No version information but update sometimes
##    If you want to join my new UI MAP editor(Another VB Program for accelerating map editing doing sth like Super Mario Maker), contact me.
##    only exe available here now, and without hacking information you cannot use it. 
##    The application must run as administrator in case it cannot run well.
##    you also need COMDLG32.OCX (x86) to run it.(it is contained in VB IDE, i cannot unload here you can download somewhere else perhaps    with COMDLG32.dll together.)
##    i recently change the language from Chinese to English for publishing, all the important parts has been translated but there might be sth not included and some bad expression haven't been fixed.
##    if you want to rebuild the level but not for a test, you need to expand your source gba file to more than 8 MB, rewrite data usually need more room. Have fun!
