#   MutiEditor for Wario Land 4 is being made with VB(some patch applications will be made with C++)
##    No version information but update sometimes, i'd like to add a number after filename just for counting the update time
##    The Visual MAP editor can run now, you can try this for render one layer, make up your own MOD file according to the JPG files and edit the layer, I will upload my MOD file when doing editing work.
##    only exe available here now, and without hacking information you cannot use it. 
##    The application must run as administrator in case it cannot run well.
##    you also need COMDLG32.OCX (x86) and comctl32.ocx (x86) to run it properlly(download and put it in the path of the exe file)
##    i recently change the language from Chinese to English for publishing, all the important parts has been translated but there might be sth not included and some bad expression haven't been fixed.
##    Now the sprites color can be showed properly, sometimes you need to use the slider
##    if you want to rebuild the level but not for a test (now you can only find suitable Tile text for yourself in the room or other rooms use the same tileset to make suitable change Or try to use the incompleted Visual editor), you need to expand your source gba file to more than 8 MB (recommanding fill with Byte FF, more suitable for my program), rewrite data usually need more room. Have fun!
