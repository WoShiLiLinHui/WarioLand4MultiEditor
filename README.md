# WarioLand4HexMutiEditor
    MutiEditor for Wario Land 4
    No version information but update sometimes
    If you want to join my new UI MAP editor(Another VB Program for accelerating map editing doing sth like Super Mario Maker), contact me
    only exe available here now, and without hacking information you cannot use it. 
    The application must run as administrator in case it cannot run well.
    you also need COMDLG32.OCX (x86) to run it.(it is contained in VB IDE, i cannot unpoad here you can download somewhere else perhaps COMDLG32.dll together.)
    i recently change the language from chinese to English for publishing, all the important part has been translated but there might be sth not include and some bad expression haven't been fixed.
    if you want to rebuild the level but not for a test, you need to expand your source gba file to more than 8 MB, rewrite data usually needs more room. Have fun!
