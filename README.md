#   MutiEditor for Wario Land 4 is being made with VB(patch applications will be made with C++)
##     The App will update sometimes. When Updating the release App, i'd like to add a number after filename just for counting the update time. 
##     The Visual MAP editor can run now, you can try this to render one layer,if you want to make sothing change, you should  make up your own MOD file according to the JPG files and load  one into the App to edit the layer, I will upload my MOD file when doing editing work.
##      Without WL4 hacking information, it will be difficult to use it properly when you try to edit enimies and some other small things, I will try to make wizard if some part of  hacking is completed.
##      I suppose you to run the App in administrator mode in case it crushes.
##     If you want to run the App, you also need COMDLG32.OCX (x86) and comctl32.ocx (x86) to run the App properlly.(download them and put it in the path of the exe file)
##    I recently change the language from Chinese to English for publishing, all the important parts has been translated but there might be sth not included and some bad expression haven't been fixed. so not all the things are showed in English now.
##      The sprites editor sometimes will not render the sprites properly, you need to use the slider to correct it.
##     If you want to rebuild the level but not for a test (now you can only find suitable Tile text for yourself in the room or other rooms use the same tileset to make suitable change Or try to use the incompleted Visual editor), you need to expand your source gba file, which is available as a patch program here now, rewrite data usually need more room.
##      This is an example:
