#   MutiEditor for Wario Land 4 made with VB
##    No version information but update sometimes, i'd like to add a number after filename just for counting the update time
##    If you want to join my new UI MAP editor(Another VB Program for accelerating map editing doing sth like Super Mario Maker), contact me.
##    only exe available here now, and without hacking information you cannot use it. 
##    The application must run as administrator in case it cannot run well.
##    you also need COMDLG32.OCX (x86) and comctl32.ocx (x86) to run it.(it is contained in VB IDE, i cannot unload here you can download somewhere else perhaps with COMDLG32.dll together.)
##    i recently change the language from Chinese to English for publishing, all the important parts has been translated but there might be sth not included and some bad expression haven't been fixed.
##    add function to show sprites color properly, sometimes you need to use the slider
##    if you want to rebuild the level but not for a test (now you can only find suitable Tile text for yourself in the room or other rooms use the same tileset to make suitable change), you need to expand your source gba file to more than 8 MB (recommanding fill with Byte FF, more suitable for my program), rewrite data usually need more room. Have fun!
