#for those who want to make progress in programming the App:
## I will be happy to get help from anyone. If it is difficult for you to comprehend all the code, I suppose you to start from Module file (two *.bas file), where I put public function.
## The Module1.bas is for all the data operation and The Module2.bas is for MAP render in the picturebox in Visual Editor
## If you would like to help, I suppose you to make your procedures into functions with necessary input and output(widget also be included in function argument) and make change in the module file. And if you are not sure what you can do, you can look into what i am doing now according to issues and README.md, and my function in processing will be marked as UNFINISHED on the side of the procedures or functions and you can help me on somethings like a botton cannot function well. 
## I will check all the change in my spare time and give a reply.
