## For contributors
# I will be happy to get help from anyone. If it is difficult for you to comprehend all the code, I suppose you to start from Module file (two *.bas file), where I put public function.
# The Module1.bas is for all the data operation and The Module2.bas is for MAP render in the picturebox in Visual Editor
# If you would like to help, I suppose you to make your procedures into functions with necessary input and output(widget also be included in function argument) and make change in the module file.
# I will check all the change in my spare time and gitve a reply.
